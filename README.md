# A p5.js Next.js/React boilerplate w/ Typescript

This is a simple boilerplate for writing p5.js sketches in Next.js/React with typescript.

It uses the awesome [@p5-wrapper/react](https://github.com/P5-wrapper/react) & [@p5-wrapper/next](https://github.com/P5-wrapper/next) libraries for rendering the `Sketch` as a `React` component and [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) for super easy `SEO` configuration.

DEMO on Vercel (https://p5-js-next-js.vercel.app/)

## Usage

Clone the repository without the whole history:<br />
`git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:mkontogiannis/p5.js-next.js.git`

The application has been created using [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) and uses its standard development / deployment process.

For `SEO` you will have to update the `seo.json` file coordingly
